# Solar System Texture System

## Overview
The solar system visualization now includes realistic texture maps for all planets, the Sun, Moon, and Saturn's rings. These textures are sourced from NASA data and provided by Solar System Scope under Creative Commons license.

## Texture Files

### Planet Textures
All planet textures are stored in `/assets/textures/` and use 2K resolution (2048x1024) for optimal performance:

- **Sun**: `sun_diffuse.jpg` - Solar surface with realistic granulation
- **Mercury**: `mercury_diffuse.jpg` - Cratered surface based on MESSENGER data
- **Venus**: `venus_diffuse.jpg` - Surface features beneath thick atmosphere
- **Earth**: `earth_diffuse.jpg` - Day map with continents and oceans
- **Mars**: `mars_diffuse.jpg` - Red planet surface with polar caps
- **Jupiter**: `jupiter_diffuse.jpg` - Gas giant bands and Great Red Spot
- **Saturn**: `saturn_diffuse.jpg` - Ringed planet with atmospheric bands
- **Uranus**: `uranus_diffuse.jpg` - Ice giant with subtle atmospheric features
- **Neptune**: `neptune_diffuse.jpg` - Deep blue ice giant
- **Moon**: `moon_diffuse.jpg` - Lunar surface with craters and maria

### Enhanced Earth Textures
Earth includes additional texture maps for enhanced realism:
- **Normal Map**: `earth_normal.jpg` - Surface height details
- **Specular Map**: `earth_specular.jpg` - Ocean reflectivity

### Saturn's Rings
- **Ring Texture**: `saturn_ring.png` - Realistic ring system with transparency

## Technical Implementation

### Texture Loading
- Textures are loaded asynchronously with proper error handling
- Fallback to procedural textures if files are missing
- Optimized texture settings for performance:
  - Anisotropic filtering for quality at distance
  - Mipmapping for performance
  - Proper UV wrapping for seamless planet mapping

### Material Configuration
Different material types are used based on celestial body characteristics:
- **Sun**: MeshBasicMaterial (emissive, no lighting needed)
- **Rocky Planets**: MeshPhongMaterial with appropriate shininess
- **Gas Giants**: MeshPhongMaterial with reduced shininess
- **Earth**: Enhanced specular properties for ocean reflection

### Performance Optimizations
- 2K resolution textures balance quality and performance
- Efficient texture compression and filtering
- Proper texture coordinate mapping
- Optimized geometry segments based on planet importance

## File Sizes
Total texture package: ~5.5MB
- Individual textures range from 12KB (Saturn rings) to 1MB (Moon)
- Reasonable for web delivery with modern internet speeds
- Progressive loading ensures smooth user experience

## Usage
Textures are automatically loaded when celestial bodies are created. The system includes:
- Automatic fallback to procedural textures
- Console logging for debugging texture loading
- Support for multiple texture types per planet
- Configurable ring systems for planets like Saturn

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the texture system:
- Higher resolution textures for close-up viewing
- Animated textures for gas giants
- Cloud layers for Earth and Venus
- Bump maps for enhanced surface detail
- Seasonal variations for Earth
